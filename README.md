# CURL Logger

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dzieciou/curl-logger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dzieciou/curl-logger/)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.dzieciou.testing/curl-logger/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.dzieciou.testing/curl-logger)

Logs HTTP requests sent by [REST-assured][9] as [CURL][1] commands.

The following request from REST-assured test
```java  
given()
  .config(config)
  .redirects().follow(false)
.when()
  .get("http://google.com")
.then()
  .statusCode(302); 
```
will be logged as:
```ba
curl 'http://google.com/' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Content-Length: 0'  -H 'Connection: Keep-Alive' 
  -H 'User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.5.2 (Java/1.8.0_112)' -H 'Content-Type: multipart/mixed' 
  --compressed -k -v
```

This way testers and developers can quickly reproduce an issue and isolate its root cause. 

## Usage

Latest release:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.dzieciou.testing</groupId>
  <artifactId>curl-logger</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```
   
### Using with REST-assured client 
    
When sending HTTP Request with REST-assured, you must create `RestAssuredConfig` instance first
 as follows:
        
```java
RestAssuredConfig config = CurlLoggingRestAssuredConfigFactory.createConfig();  
```
  
and then use it:

```java
given()
  .config(config)
  ...
```

If you already have a `RestAssuredConfig` instance, you may reconfigure it as follows:

```java
RestAssuredConfig config = ...;
config = CurlLoggingRestAssuredConfigFactory.updateConfig(config);  
```

The library provides a number of options for the way curl is generated and logged. They can be
defined with `Options` class. For instance:
 
```java
Options options = Options.builder()...build();
RestAssuredConfig config = CurlLoggingRestAssuredConfigFactory.createConfig(options);  
```

There is a separate section listing all options.
 
### Configuring logger 

CURL commands are logged to a "curl" logger. The library requires only the logger to be [slf4j][4]-compliant, e.g.,
using [logback][5]. Sample logback configuration that logs all CURL commands to standard system output would be:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%-4relative [%thread] %-5level %logger{35} - %msg %n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
    <logger name="curl" level="DEBUG">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </logger>
</configuration>
```


## Options

### Printing stacktrace

The library provides a way to log stacktrace where the curl was generated:
```java  
Options.builder().logStacktrace().build();
```
This might be particularly useful when your test is sending multiple requests and you cannot find
which request generated  printed curl command.



By default `CurlLoggingRestAssuredConfigFactory#createConfig` creates configuration that prints a curl command in
 a single line.


### Configure log level

There is a way to define at which log level the log statement should be created:
```java  
Options.builder().logLevel(Level.INFO).build();
```

By default the curl commands are generated at `DEBUG` level, but depending on the context it might be handy to log at an higher level.

If the log level is set to `null` no log entries are generated.


### Generating curl for Windows vs Unix 

The curl command generated by the library is platform-specific.

For instance, curl command generated for Unix platform

```bash
curl 'http://testapi.com/post' --data-binary $'{\r\n   \'name\':\'Administra\xe7\xe3o\',\r\n   
  \'email\':\'admin\x40gmail.com\',\r\n   \'password\':\'abc%"\'\r\n}'
```

will look different when generated for Windows platform:

```cmd
curl "http://testapi.com/post" --data-binary "{"^

"   'name':'Administração',"^

"   'email':'admin@gmail.com',"^

"   'password':'abc"%"""'"^

"}"
```

The difference is in:
- how strings are quoted,
- how different characters (non-ASCII characters,
non-printable ASCII characters and characters with special meaning) are escaped,
- and how new lines in multiline command are printed.

By default, the library assumes the target platform on which curl command will be executed is the 
same as the platform where it was generated. However, when you work on two different platforms, 
sometimes a curl command generated on Unix might not be portable to Windows, and vice-versa.  

In such situations, the library provides a way to force target platform, e.g.,:
```java
Options.builder().targetPlatform(Platform.UNIX).build();
```

Even if origin and target platform are the same, some characters must be escaped, because 
the generated curl command will be copy-pasted on a multitude of setups by a wide range of people. 
I don't want the result to vary based on people's local encoding or misconfigured terminals. The 
downside of this might be less legible commands like `Administra\xe7\xe3o` instead of 
`Administração`. If you want your commands to be more legible (and bound to specific terminal setups)
you may disable escaping non-ASCII characters by using the following option (for Unix only):
```java
Options.builder().dontEscapeNonAscii().build();
```

### Printing curl in multiple lines

The library enables printing a curl command in multiple lines:
```java
Options.builder().printMultiliner().build();
```

On Unix systems it will look like this:
```bash
curl 'http://google.pl/' \ 
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \ 
  --data-binary 'param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value' \ 
  --compressed \ 
  -k \ 
  -v
```
and on Windows:
```cmd
curl 'http://google.pl/' ^ 
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' ^ 
  --data-binary 'param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value' ^ 
  --compressed ^ 
  -k ^ 
  -v
```

### Logging request body

Note, for either platform, the body of a request is always logged as `--binary-data` instead of 
`--data` because the latter  strips newline (`\n`) and carriage return (`\r`) characters. 

### Printing curl parameters in long form

The library enables printing longer form of curl parameters, e.g. `--header` instead of `-H`:
```java
Options.builder().useLongForm().build();
```

Here's an example of a curl command generated with parameters in default short form (note, not 
all parameters have corresponding short form):

```bash
curl 'http://google.pl/' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Host: google.pl' 
  -H 'User-Agent: 'User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.5.2 (Java/1.8.0_112)' 
  -H 'Connection: Keep-Alive' --data-binary 'param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value' --compressed -k -v
```

After enabling long form option it would look as follows:

```bash
curl 'http://google.pl/' -header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' 
  --header 'Host: google.pl'  --header 'User-Agent: 'User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.5.2 
     (Java/1.8.0_112)' --header 'Connection: Keep-Alive' 
  --data-binary 'param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value' --compressed --insecure --verbose
```

By default `CurlLoggingRestAssuredConfigFactory#createConfig` create configuration  that prints
 a curl command parameters in short form.

## Updating curl command before print

The library provides a way to modify curl command before 
printing:
```java
Options.builder().updateCurl(curl -> ...).build();
```

`#updateCurl` method takes instance of `Consumer<CurlCommand>` class. `CurlCommand` is a mutable 
representation of curl and offers a number of methods to modify it: `#addHeader`, `#removeHeader`, etc.

This is useful to:
* modify generated curl to test different variations of the same case
* remove certain headers or parameters to make curl command more consise and thus easier to read

For instance, if you would like skip common headers like "Host", "User-Agent" and "Connection" 
from the following curl command:
```bash
curl 'http://google.pl/' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Host: google.pl'  
  -H 'User-Agent: 'User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.5.2 (Java/1.8.0_112)' 
  -H 'Connection: Keep-Alive'  --data-binary 'param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value' --compressed -k -v
```

you should define `Options` as follows:
```java
Options.builder()
  .updateCurl(curl -> curl
    .removeHeader("Host")
    .removeHeader("User-Agent")
    .removeHeader("Connection"))
  .build();
```

As a result it will generate the following curl:
```
curl 'http://google.pl/' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' 
  --data-binary 'param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value' --compressed -k -v
```

### Capture curl command

The library provides a way to capture curl commands that will be logged.
This can be useful if the test suite execution log is not the place where the curl commands needs to be stored.

Just register as many `Consumer<String>` as you would like.
Their `accept()` method will be called each time a log command is generated. 

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); //The consumer is the list add() method (curl commands are stored in this list)
Options.builder().addConsumer(list::add).build();
```


## Other features

### Logging attached files

When you attach a file to your requests via `multiPart`, e.g., sending content of "README.md" file

```java
given()
  .config(new CurlLoggingRestAssuredConfigFactory.create)
  .baseUri("http://someHost.com")
  .multiPart("myfile", new File("README.md"), "application/json")
.when()
  .post("/uploadFile");
```

the library will automatically include reference to it instead of pasting its content:
```
curl 'http://somehost.com/uploadFile' -F 'myfile=@README.md;type=application/json' -X POST ...
```

Note, this won't work when uploading File not via `multipart`. Instead, content of the file will be
printed.

```java
given()
  .config(new CurlLoggingRestAssuredConfigFactory.create)
  .baseUri("http://someHost.com")
  .body(new File("README.md"))
.when()
  .post("/uploadFile");
```
